This is an example directory for buildings in the OASIS SDM National Standards format. There are dummy text files in each folder that follow the filename convention that should be followed---One is an example for XX0000 and the other is a generic filename showing the pieces of the filename with <VARIABLES> that should be replaced when working on live drawings.

For a full generic version of filenames and directory structure at a glance, see README.md in "R09 SDM Drawings/_Instructions" directory.

In this directory all dummy text files to represent what reality would be in a real building directory. Therefore, all files will look like they have the right extension, but should be opened in a text editor (e.g. vim, Nano, Notepad, etc.).
