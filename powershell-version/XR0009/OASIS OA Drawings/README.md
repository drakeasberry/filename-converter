For each OASIS OA Drawing request, create a directory named as the OA Number.

OA Number Formatting:
A: all OA numbers start with letter 'A'
XX: the second and third characters are always the two-letter state abbreviation
#####: The last five characters are always system generated numbers

Note: On the OASIS Web Portal (Front-End) you will see a tag suffixed in certain screens with a versioning key where the X will increase by one with each revision.
<-X> -0 = Created in OASIS 
<-30X> -301 = OA Tool Migrated to OASIS

This directory will house all planning drawings for all design options created for the scenario request.
